A Kaboom clone for the CHIP-8

## How to Play

This game was written in about a day just for fun. I think that Kaboom for the
Atari is just a fun game so I wanted to port it to the CHIP-8.

The controls are very simple: `A` moves left and `D` moves right. That's it.
Press `E` to start/restart the game

In order to run this you will need a CHIP-8 emulator/virtual machine, I just
happen to have written one [here](https://git.sr.ht/~bpv/c8).
